# live-update-graph-Dash

# I havent been coding for a long time so sorry for all the elaborate extra information
# but it helps me structure my code.
# This code is supposed to solve the reload webpage problem if you use the Dash code.
# This problem occurs as a consequence of the data being created in the callback. It causes the data
# to update at every webpage load. If your placing your Dash live-update graph online and multiple people
# will try to access your webpage this will cause you app to shift into the future... :-)
